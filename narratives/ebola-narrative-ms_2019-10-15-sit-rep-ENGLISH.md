#[8 newly sequenced cases from Mambasa](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-10-15?clade=c26&f_health_zone=Mambasa&d=tree)

We report here 8 newly sequenced cases from Mambasa. These are: KOM2884, KOM3014, KOM3043, MAM025, KOM2902, KOM2933, KOM2973, and KOM2796. These sequences are diverse, which suggests higher total numbers of cases in this health zone. Nesting within clade c26, we see multiple groups of Mambasa genomes. Four of these clades are newly observed with the most recent sequence data.

#[Some Mambasa genomes are highly diverged, suggesting unsequenced transmission](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-10-15?clade=c26&f_health_zone=Mambasa&m=div&d=tree)

KOM2796 from Mambasa is highly diverged, having 9 unique mutations separating it from the ancestor of this clade. This suggests that multiple unsequenced infections preceded KOM2796's infection. We recommend referring to the case history data to determine whether this is a transmission chain that was unobserved, or if the previous cases were recorded but not sent for sequencing. KOM2933 is 6 nucleotide mutations different from its most closely related sequence (KOM2973). Similarly, this suggests that there were multiple infections that occurred between these two cases. We recommend reviewing the surveillance data to assess wether these intervening infections were recorded but not sequenced, or whether they were undetected.

#[New sequence from Mandima](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-10-15?clade=c21&d=tree,map)

A newly sequenced genome from Mandima, BEN30895, clusters with other genomes from Mandima and Beni, in a clade that is descended from transmission that was occurring in Rwampara. Given that it is only one nucleotide different from other viruses in this clade, BEN30895 could have been directly infected by MAN7843, BEN31595, MAN8153, or by another unsequenced case with links to these other individuals.

#[New sequence from Oicha](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-10-15?clade=c16&d=tree)
BEN34333, a case sampled from Oicha, groups in clade c24 with genomes from Katwa. It has 7 unique mutations that separate it from the ancestor of clade c24, indicating person-to-person transmission occurring between the source case and BEN34333. From the genomic data alone we cannot determine whether this intervening transmission occurred within Katwa or Oicha. To assess whether this case from Oicha represents a single spillover from Katwa into Oicha, or whether there is sustained transmission within Oicha, we recommend assessing BEN34333's travel and contact history.

#[Two new sequences from Komanda](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-10-15?clade=c25&d=tree)
KOM2855 and KOM2953, both sequences sampled from Komanda, appear to be unrelated infections despite being sampled 4 days apart. KOM2855 clusters within clade c26, while KOM2953 is most closely related to another newly sequenced sample, KOM2823. KOM2823 lacks health zone information.

#[MWG017 groups with samples from Mwenga](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-10-15?clade=c29&d=tree&p=full)
MWG017, which did not have information about the health zone that it was sampled from, groups in clade c38 with sequences from Mwenga.

#[MWG016 groups in clade c26](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-10-15?clade=c26&d=tree&m=div)

MWG016, which did not have information about the health zone that it was sampled from, groups in clade c26. This is a large clade that clusters samples from many health zones. Additionally, this sequence has 11 unique mutations that differ from the common ancestor of this clade, supporting a sustained transmission chain that was not sequenced. Without more sequence data, we cannot specify where this transmission chain was primarily circulating.
