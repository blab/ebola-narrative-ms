#[Sequenced case from Kyondo most closely related to cases from Musienene](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-09-21?clade=c26&f_health_zone=Kyondo,Musienene&d=tree)

Cluster c34 contains 3 cases, 2 of which are newly sequenced. The two newly sequenced cases are BTB26888 from Kyondo and KAT10876 from Musienene. Cluster c34 also contains a previously sequenced case from Musienene, KAT10120. KAT10120 and KAT10876 have the exact same genome sequence, indicating that these cases are closely linked. BTB26888, the case from Kyondo, is related to the Musienene sequences, but is diverged from them by two mutations. This divergence indicates that there were probably transmission events that occurred between the Musienene cases and the Kyondo case. From the genomic data alone we cannot tell whether those intervening infections were reported, and simply not sequenced, or whether they were undetected. Contact tracing data and more sequencing data would help to differentiate whether the intervening cases occurred in Musienene or in Kyondo.

#[Additional sequenced cases from Kalunguta in clusters c30 and c31](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-09-21?clade=c33&f_health_zone=Kalunguta&d=tree)

KAT10952, sequenced from a case detected in Kalunguta, groups within cluster c30, a cluster previously known to circulate in Kalunguta. KAT10952 is genetically identical to BTB20304 and BTB21628, two previously sequenced cases detected in Kalunguta. These cases are likely closely linked. BEN31926 lacked information about which health zone it was sampled from, but it groups within cluster c31 with other samples from Kalunguta, including previously discussed cases BTB22334, BTB22982, BTB24630, BTB24909, and BTB24518. Therefore, we think that BEN31926 was likely also infected in Kalunguta.

#[Three new cases in the primary transmission chain circulating in Mandima](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-09-21?clade=c26&f_health_zone=Mandima&d=tree)

Three newly sequenced cases from Mandima, MAN8039, MAN7953, MAN7978, group within cluster c26, which appears to be the primary transmission chain currently circulating in Mandima. This cluster contains 16 sequenced cases from Mandima, and 12 of these cases have the exact same genome sequence, and indicator that the cases are closely linked.

#[Fourth case from Mandima most closely related to cases from Rwampara](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-09-21?clade=c20&f_health_zone=Mandima,Rwampara&d=tree)

A fourth case from Mandima, MAN8153, groups within cluster c21, which contains primarily sequences from Rwampara. In this case, the genomic data supports a scenario in which Ebola moved from Mandima into Rwampara and then back into Mandima. Although MAN8153 is most closely related to sequences from Rwampara, it is still diverged from them, indicating that MAN8153 is probably not directly linked to the sequenced cases in Rwampara. Rather, there were likely additional cases that occurred prior to MAN8153's infection. From our data, we cannot tell whether those intervening cases were reported but not sequenced, or if they were not reported at all, nor can we tell whether those additional cases might have occurred in Rwampara or in Mandima. We recommend further sequencing of cases in this cluster, and review of contact histories, to elucidate this.
