#[Broad-scale descriptive epidemiological dynamics](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms?d=tree)

The genomic data suggest that the outbreak began in late-July 2018 in the Mabalako. There appears to have been movement into Beni and Mandima shortly thereafter, as identical genome sequences were collected from Mabalako, Beni, and Mandima. The genomic data support multiple introductions of EVD from Mabalako into Beni. One of these introductions led to extensive onward transmission into other health zones, becoming the primary circulating lineage in this outbreak. We also observe that transmission chains have moved back into previously affected health zones. For example, the primary outbreak lineage moved from Beni into Kalunguta around October 2018, which later led to multiple introductions into Katwa between October 2018 and January 2019. One of the transmission chains circulating in Katwa (descended from clade c12) moved back into Beni some time between late-February and June 2019.

A secondary persistent lineage (descendents of clade c19) resulted from an introduction from Beni to Katwa sometime between August and October 2018. This lineage later moved in to Mandima, Rwampara, and back into Katwa. Although smaller than the primary outbreak lineage, this secondary lineage has persisted throughout much of the outbreak. Genomes grouping in this lineage were sampled from infections in Mandima and Beni as recent as September 2019.

#[Fine-scale transmission dynamics: sources and sinks](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms?clade=c26&d=tree)

Genomic data suggest that clade c26 circulated primarily in Mandima health zone. Genomes from other health zones, including Butembo (clade c27), Mambasa (clade c36), and Kayna (clade c28), descend from clade c26. Under the assumption that these sequenced cases are random samples of circulating EVD infections, this pattern suggests that Mandima acted as a source of infections, seeding transmission chains in Butembo, Mambasa, and Kayna that circulated within those health zones but did not move beyond them.

Between August 26th and September 1st, 2019, seven new cases of EVD collected from Kalunguta health zone were sequenced. Despite coming from the same health zone and having similar sample collection dates, these sequences cluster into three separate clades:c30, c31, and c32. Each of these clades appear to have resulted from separate introductions from Beni. Contact history information for cases in cluster c31 indicated that this was a known transmission cluster, an inference that is reinforced by the genomic data. The genomic data indicate that other samples collected from Kalunguta in late August and early September 2019, including KAT10686, BTB24923, and KAT10952, are part of separate transmission chains. In particular, clade c32 is quite diverged from other samples in Kalunguta, but only groups together two sequenced samples, KAT10686 and BTB24923. This finding indicates that clade c32 was circulating, but was not detected by genomic surveillance, prior to these two new cases from Kalunguta. This dynamic could occur if cases are detected, but not sequenced, or if this cluster is circulating undetected. Thus this type of finding must be assessed in the context of the case surveillance data to determine whether it represents a previously undetected EVD transmission.

#[Fine-scale transmission dynamics: Superspreading](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms?clade=c25&m=div&d=tree)

A superspreading event, as supported by both genomic data and case history data, is shown in clade c25. KAT5915 was a significant figure in the community who died of EVD. Their funeral, which did not follow EVD safe burial protocols, was widely attended. Exposure at the funeral led to further cases in Beni, as well as infections in individuals from Butembo, Ariwara, and Oicha. Many of these samples have sequences with no differences or only one nucleotide difference compared to KAT5915's genome sequence. Taken within the context provided by the case history data, this finding indicates probable direct transmission events from KAT5915 to KAT7440, BEN22409, BUN1572, BEN22431, BEN16085, BTB18181, and MAN5909.

#[Fine-scale transmission dynamics: Differentiating direct transmission from propagated transmission](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms?clade=c49&d=tree)

Clade c49 is a cluster that circulated in Beni. BEN41281 was sampled on November 17, 2019. Three additional cases from Beni, BEN42330, BEN42331, and BEN42332, were sampled on December 3 2019, 16 days later. We postulated that these three individuals, whose infections all share a T to C substitution at site 6700, might all share a single direct source. BEN42330 and BEN42332 have identical genome sequences and BEN41281 has one additional substitution, a G to A substitution at site 17695. Given the rate of evolution observed across the sequence data, we can model the probability of observing a certain number of mutations assuming a particular number of serial intervals separate two sequences. Given that two of the samples here are separated by zero substitutions, and one has diverged by one substitution, the genomic data are consistent with a scenario in which these cases were infected by a single source.
