# [New sequences from transmission cluster in Kayna](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-09-14?clade=c26&f_health_zone=Kayna&d=tree)

Three newly sequenced cases, BTB24232, BTB23817 and BTB24057, all from Kayna, share a common mutation and group together in cluster c28. We infer that the common ancestor of these cases existed around 2 weeks prior to the detection of these cases, and that the mutation that characterizes this cluster occurred in late July or early August. This indicates that these cases are likely closely linked. Contact tracing data indicates that BUT8849 is the probable source case of these three infections, but since BUT8849 was not sequenced, we cannot confirm this with the genomic data.

A fourth case from Kayna, BTB20594, does not cluster within c28. Given that BTB20594 has an earlier sampling date and lacks the common mutation shared by cases in cluster c28, BTB20594 was likely infected prior to the other three cases. It is possible that BTB20594 could be an earlier case in the same transmission chain as BTB24232, BTB23817 and BTB24057, although we would need more genomic data and verification with contact tracing histories to be sure.

# [Multiple co-circulating transmission chains in Kalunguta.](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-09-14?clade=c33&f_health_zone=Kalunguta&d=tree)

Here we show seven new sequences from cases in Kalunguta. These cases are BTB24630, BTB22982, BTB24909, BTB24518, BTB24923, KAT10686, and BTB22852. Despite the fact that all of these cases were sampled in Kalunguta, they are genetically diverse, and cluster into three separate groups. BTB24630, BTB22982, BTB24909, and BTB24518 cluster together with BTB22334 within cluster c31. Given that BTB22334 is the least genetically diverged of the c31 samples, it could be the source case in this transmission cluster. This agrees with contact tracing data indicating that BTB22334 is the source case for BTB22982. We do not have sequences from any of the other source cases indicated in the contact tracing data, and therefore cannot confirm the other hypothesized links.

BTB24923 and KAT10686 cluster together within c32, and are genetically diverged from cases in cluster c31 even though the cases were sampled at roughly the same time. The genomic data therefore indicate that BTB24923 and KAT10686 represent a separate transmission chain from the cases in c31. The last newly sequenced case, BTB22852, has a genome that is quite diverged from the other Kalunguta cases, and groups within cluster c30. This indicates that BTB22852 is unrelated to the other newly sequenced cases discussed here. When putting the genomic data together with the sampling date of the cases, we find evidence of at least three separate transmission chains that are co-circulating in Kalunguta.
