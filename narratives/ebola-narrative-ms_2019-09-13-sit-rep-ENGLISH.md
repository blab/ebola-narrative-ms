#[Background information on the source case, KAT5915.](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-09-13?clade=c25&s=lab-KAT5915&d=tree)
KAT5915 had a traditional funeral that was widely attended, and likely was the primary exposure for many other cases detected later on.

#[Evidence for direct transmission between KAT5915 and two other sequenced cases.](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-09-13?clade=c25&dmax=2019-07-10&m=div&d=tree)

If we look at the tree showing only genetic distance, we see that there are multiple cases with the exact same genome sequence as that of KAT5915, as shown by the dots stacked vertically but at the same x-axis position, which shows genetic divergence. These other samples are BEN22409, KAT7440, and BUN1572. The fact that these cases have the exact same genome sequence indicates that they were likely infected directly by contact with KAT5915, in contrast to propagated transmission with infections occurring sequentially.

#[Exposure to KAT5915 seeds transmission in at least 16 other health zones.](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-09-13?clade=c25&d=tree)

The cases that were likely directly infected due to contact with KAT5915 (BEN22409, BUN1572, and KAT7440), were detected in 3 health zones: Ariwara, Oicha, and Butembo (health zone information is not known for KAT7440). When looking at propagated transmission descended from this event, we observe transmission in various additional health zones. In particular, we see evidence for larger clusters of ongoing transmission occurring in Mandima, Kayna, Butembo and possibly Kalunguta, which we describe in more detail below.

#[Propagated transmission in Mandima.](hhttps://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-09-13?clade=c25&f_health_zone=Mandima&d=tree)
The genomic data show evidence of transmission in Mandima starting approximately one month after KAT5915's infection was sampled. Given that this length of time is longer than the Ebola incubation period, we suspect that intermediate infections were either not detected, or were detected but not sequenced. Five of the six sequenced cases from Mandima (MAN5923, MAN5931, MAN5933, MAN5938, and MAN5971) have identical genomes, which indicates that they were likely infected by the same source case. The sixth sequenced case, BTB21678, has more genetic differences, and therefore likely represents propagated transmission within Mandima.  

#[Propagated transmission in Butembo.](https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/ebola-narrative-ms/sitrep-2019-09-13?clade=c25&f_health_zone=Butembo,Mandima&d=tree)

From the genomic data we observe multiple introductions of Ebola back into Butembo after propagated transmission in other health zones. For example, propagated transmission occurring in Mandima moved from Mandima back to Butembo. This is suggested by the genomic data as the nesting of Butembo samples in cluster c27 within the genetic diversity of cluster c26, which circulated in Mandima. In addition, we see introductions of Ebola into Butembo that are most closely related to transmission occurring in Kalunguta (cluster c30) and Beni (cluster c29).
